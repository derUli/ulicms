Release of UliCMS 9.0.0 scheduled for first quarter of 2016

The release of UliCMS 9.0.0 is scheduled for the first quarter of 2016. 
This new version of UliCMS will introduce support for the newest web technologies,
including an improved template engine, an updated jQuery, HTML5 video and audio.

It's the modern, flexible and extensible open source content management 
solution youâ€™d expect from the developer of UliCMS.

Other improvements will include better security, better configurability and the
introduction of an one-click patch management utility, which will make it much easier to keep your system
up-to-date.

Starting with this release UliCMS will follow a slower release cycle than before, releasing a new version every 1 to 3 years, since you should spend your time to manage your content and not to maintain your CMS.
