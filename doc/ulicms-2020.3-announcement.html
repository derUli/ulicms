        </h1>
        <p>
            I hope you are keeping yourself in good health in these hard times.
            More than one month later than originally scheduled I present
            the new UliCMS version 2020.3 which
            is the main release for the third quarter of 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main features of this new release are the reintroduced page
            filters and  the new RESPONSIVE filemanager that removes the 
            dead kcfinder component for media file upload and management.
            Other features include better usability and performance improvements.
        </p>
        <h2>Page Filters</h2>
        <p>
            When UliCMS 2020.2 was released the page filters feature
            wasn't ready yet.
            The 2020.3 release reenables this feature.
        </p>
        <h2>RESPONSIVE filemanager</h2>
        <p>
            RESPONSIVE filemanager is a file manager component which 
            replaces the outdated KCFinder.
            It provides browser based file uploads and selections.
        </p>
        <h2>Other Improvements</h2>
        <p>
            Shorts are now automatically copied to clipboard on click.
           
            Duplicate usage of a slug for a languge is now prevented.
            New Robo tasks were added.
            Additional changes include usability and performance improvements.
