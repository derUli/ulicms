            UliCMS 2020.1 offers a large amount of new features for
            designing your website project.
        </p>
        <h2>Performance</h2>
        <p>The page list in backend is now paginated.
            That means that only the current visible datasets are loaded
            into the memory. That improves the backend performance in projects
            with more than a few hundred pages drastically.</p>
        <p>Generated PDF documents will now also be cached.</p>
