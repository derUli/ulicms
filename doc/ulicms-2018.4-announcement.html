	<h1>UliCMS 2018.4 has many new features</h1>
	<p>The new UliCMS Release 2018.4 is the result of 3 months of
		development.</p>
	<p>The release 2018.4 focuses on usability, privacy and performance
		features.</p>
	<h2>Major Features in this Release</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Usability Improvements</li>
		<li>Support for the legal requirements of the General Data
			Protection Regulation (GDPR)</li>
		<li>Better Performance</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Usability Improvements</h3>
	<p>Tables are now shown with the DataTable jQuery Plugin. Tables
		now have a pagination. There is an option to configure how many
		entries are shown per page. As an extra there is now a live search for
		all datatables.</p>
	<p>The forms "create page" and "edit page" are now clearer. The
		count of areas were reduced by joining areas with similiar topics and
		by moving rarely used options to the new "Others" accordion area.</p>
	<h3>Support for GDPR Requirements</h3>
	<p>The new privacy settings has an option to add a GDPR accept
		privacy checkbox. The checkbox may be integrated into forms and with
		an API to your own modules.</p>
	<p>
		The Right to receive information about the stored data and the right
		to request the deletion of the stored data can be implemented with the
		module <a href="https://extend.ulicms.de/personal_data_export.html">personal_data_export</a>.
	</p>
	<h3>Improved Performance</h3>
	<p>The performance was improved. Indices was added to some database
		tables.</p>
	<p>Javascript- and CSS codes are now better minified. Additionally
		obsolete spaces and newlines are removed from the HTML.</p>
