        <p>
            I hope all users of UliCMS had a happy new year despite the adversity caused by the pandemic politics.
            As many have already noticed, the release for the fourth quarter did not appear last year.
            This is mainly due to the fact that I am currently giving UliCMS less time than usual
            due to the shifting of my Internet activities to social media and a certain technology fatigue.
            Unfortunately, I did not finish the update of the Bootstrap version to 5.x, which was actually planned for 2021.4, in time.
            There were no other new features, so I skipped UliCMS 2021.4.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just let everyone know that the project is not dead.
            If anyone has questions, wants to report bugs, or submit 
            suggestions for improvement, they can always contact me.
        </p>

            UlICMS 2022.1 is a small release that contains only a few visible improvements.
            The installer now checks whether the PHP version is supported and whether
            the required PHP modules are installed and activated. 
            Fixed some user interface bugs. 
            Added new robo task "tests:update-snapshots". 
            The JavaScript and PHP packages have been updated.
