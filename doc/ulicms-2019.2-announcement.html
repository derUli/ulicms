        <h1>UliCMS 2019.2 with improved User Interface</h1>
        <p>
            The second quarter of 2019 UliCMS release focuses on usability and
            security improvements. An additional new value for developers is the new
            *.scss compiler which is fully integrated into the stylesheet queue API.
        </p>
        <h2>Look and Feel & Usability</h2>
        <p>
            Backend buttons nove have icons. Menus were added to backend pages with
            subpages (e.g. on all subpages of "Contents".
        </p>
        <p>Users and groups were grouped under one menu item.</p>
        <p>
            The "packages" backend page got a full redesign. The redesigned UI has all
            features of the previous UI.
            Additionally there is a button to enable and disable modules.
            You can switch between the old packages view and the new one.
            However the old view will be removed in a future version of UliCMS.
        </p>
        <p>
            The option "hide logo" is now located at the "Logo" settings page. In
            previous releases that option was located at the "General Settings" page.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a user is not permitted to use the user interface of a module, the
            button is now disabled and a lock icon is shown right to the button with
            the menu name.
        </p>

        <h2>New Security and Antispam Features</h2>
        <p>
            Die Optionen "XSS-Schutz" und "Erlauben diese Webseite in andere Sites
            einzubinden" zur Steuerung von sicherheitsrelevanten HTTP-Headern wurden
            hinzugef√ºgt.
        </p>
        <p>
            The option "Disallow RTL-Languages" were added to the anti-spam settings.
            If this option is enabled comments which are containing arabic, persian or
            hebrew chars are rejected.
        </p>

        <h2>Developer Features</h2>
        <p>
            A <a href="http://leafo.github.io/scssphp/">SCSS compiler</a> was added to
            the core. The stylesheet queue now supports *.scss files.
        </p>
        <p>
            The textarea "Custom Data (JSON)" now uses the CodeMirror code editor.
        </p>
        <h2>Additional New Features</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            UliCMS now supports multiple configuration environments. The configuration
            environment can be switched by setting the ULICMS_ENVIRONMENT environment
            var. The default value for ULICMS_ENVIRONMENT is "default".
        </p>
        <p>You can now enable and disable forms and advertisement banners.</p>
        <p>
            The period in which an advertisement banner is displayed can now be
            limited.
        </p>
