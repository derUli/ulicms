            UliCMS 2023.1 is one of the most significant software releases of the last years.
            It was updated to fit a more modern coding style with Autoloaders, namespaces, removal of deprecated features and many
            other measures to make the code base more modern.<br>
            However this release is just a start of ongoing improvements of the base system.

            Additionally to new coding standards and some bugfixes it also contains theese new features and improvements:
