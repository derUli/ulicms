This document describes how to install UliCMS on an apache webserver.

1. Upload the content of the "ulicms" folder into the main document folder of your webserver.

   Notice:
   An installation in a subfolder is possible but not recommend.

   Replace [your-domain] with the domain of your website (e.g. http://www.myhomepage.de/installer).

3. The installation tool will guide you through the installation procedure.

4. When you finished the installation procedure delete the "installer" folder from your server.

5. Open http://[your-domain]/admin to edit your website.
   Replace [your-domain] with the domain of your website (e.g. http://www.myhomepage.de/admin).
